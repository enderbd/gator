# gator

For now just a minimal description.

The following requirements are needed for this to run:

- Go installed
- Postgres installed

Once those are in place, you could open a prompt/terminal/comman line and type:

- go install github.com/enderbd/gator@latest

Once its installed, there are a few commands that can be used:

- gator register <username>
- gator addfeed <feedurl>
- gator follow <feedurl>
- gator following
- gator agg <interval>
- gator browse

Will fully describe them in the near future!
